For example, say an artifact causes your opponent to exile his or her hand of three cards face down. Then on a later turn, that artifact causes your opponent to exile another two cards face down.

If you want to put a face-down card in exile into its owners graveyard, you must first choose one of these groups and then choose a card from within that group at random. For example, say an artifact causes your opponent to exile his or her hand of three cards face down. Then on a later turn, that artifact causes your opponent to exile another two cards face down. If you use Wasteland Strangler to put one of those cards into his or her graveyard, you would pick the first or second pile and put a card chosen at random from that pile into the graveyard.||Devoid #_(This card has no color.)_#When Ulamog's Reclaimer enters the battlefield, you may put a card an opponent owns from exile into that player's graveyard.

Gods|BNG|378373|Instant||||{1}{W}|2|Slawomir Maniak||W||1|U|3.378|9/15/2013 : Numeric mana symbols ({0}, {1}, and so on) in mana costs of permanents you control dont count toward your devotion to any color.9/15/2013 : Mana symbols in the text boxes of permanents you control dont count toward your devotion to any color.9/15/2013 : Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s).9/15/2013 : If an activated ability or triggered ability has an effect that depends on your devotion to a color, you count the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents you control as the ability resolves. The permanent with that ability will be counted if its still on the battlefield at that time.2/1/2014 : Acolytes Reward has two targets: the creature that would be dealt damage and the creature or player that Acolytes Reward will deal damage to. These targets are chosen as you cast Acolytes Reward.2/1/2014 : The amount of damage the prevention shield will prevent is based on your devotion to white as Acolytes Reward resolves. That amount wont change later in the turn, even if your devotion to white does.2/1/2014 : You dont choose a source of damage. The prevention shield will apply to the next X damage that would be dealt to the first target, no matter where that damage comes from. It also doesnt matter whether the damage is dealt at the same time. For example, if the shield prevents the next 5 damage to the first target, and that creature would be dealt 3 damage by Lightning Strike, that 3 damage is prevented and Acolytes Reward deals 3 damage to the second target. The prevention effect will still apply to the next 2 damage the first target would be dealt that turn.2/1/2014 : The effect of Acolytes Reward isnt a redirection effect. If it prevents damage, Acolytes Reward (not the source of that damage) deals damage to the second target as part of that prevention effect. Acolytes Reward is the source of the new damage, so the characteristics of the original source (such as its color or whether it had lifelink) dont apply. The new damage isnt combat damage, even if the prevented damage was. Since you control the source of the new damage, if the second target is an opponent, you may have Acolytes Reward deal its damage to a planeswalker that opponent controls.2/1/2014 : As Acolytes Reward tries to resolve, if only the first target is illegal, Acolytes Reward wont prevent any damage that would be dealt to that creature and, because of this, Acolytes Reward wont deal damage to the second target. If only the second target is illegal, damage that would be dealt to the first target will be prevented, but Acolytes Reward wont deal damage. If both targets are illegal, Acolytes Reward will be countered.2/1/2014 : After Acolytes Reward resolves, it no longer matters whether either target is still legal. For example, if the second target is a creature controlled by an opponent, and it gains hexproof after Acolytes Reward resolves but before it prevents damage, Acolytes Reward will still deal damage to that creature. If Acolytes Reward cant deal damage to the second target (perhaps because its a creature that has left the battlefield), Acolytes Reward will still prevent damage; it just wont deal any damage itself.2/1/2014 : If Acolytes Reward prevents damage, it deals its damage immediately afterward as part of that same prevention effect. This happens before state-based actions are performed, and before any player can cast spells or activate abilities. If the source of the original damage was a spell or ability, this happens before that spell or ability resumes its resolution.2/1/2014 : If the amount of damage that would be dealt to the first target is in excess of the amount of damage that Acolytes Reward would prevent, the source deals its excess damage to the first target at the same time that the rest of it is prevented. Then Acolytes Reward deals its damage.2/1/2014 : The damage will be dealt by Acolytes Reward as it existed on the stack, not as it exists when the damage is dealt. That is, its an instant spell thats dealing the damage, in case an ability cares about that (such as Satyr Firedancers, which includes the phrase Whenever an instant or sorcery spell you control deals damage to an opponent).2/1/2014 : If the first target would be dealt combat damage by multiple creatures, you choose which of that damage to prevent. (For example, if one of those creatures has deathtouch, you could choose to prevent the damage from that creature specifically.) You dont decide until the point at which the creatures would deal their damage.2/1/2014 :||Prevent the next X damage that would be dealt to target creature this turn, where X is your devotion to white. If damage is prevented this way, Acolyte's Reward deals that much damage to target creature or player. #_(Each {W} in the mana costs of permanents you control counts toward your devotion to white.)_#||||||||1|||Rcompense de l'acolyte|Belohnung des Tempeldieners|Ricompensa dell'Accolito||Recompensa do Aclito| |Recompensa del aclito|  |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||True|||||||||||||Aerie Worshippers|Born of the Gods|BNG|378402|Creature  Human Cleric|2|4||{3}{U}|4|Mike Sass|#_They can conjure stars from a clear sky._#|U||30|U|3.662|2/1/2014 : Inspired abilities trigger no matter how the creature becomes untapped: by the turn-based action at the beginning of the untap step or by a spell or ability.2/1/2014 : If an inspired ability triggers during your untap step, the ability will be put on the stack at the beginning of your upkeep.

If neither stat of the new creature is greater, evolve wont trigger at all.4/15/2013 : If evolve triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare the stats.4/15/2013 : If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger.4/15/2013 : If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing.4/15/2013 : When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, its possible that the stat thats greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa.

When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing.4/15/2013 : When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, its possible that the stat thats greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and youll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.

Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash wont allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spellas as though they have flash will.4/26/2014 : On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. Its never both, although its an enchantment spell in either case.4/26/2014 : Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isnt countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.4/26/2014 : Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isnt put into its owners graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if its been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.4/26/2014 : If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You cant choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.4/26/2014 : Auras attached to a creature dont become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.4/26/2014 : An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owners graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as its a creature. While its a creature, it cant be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura thats not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isnt a creature will be put into its owners graveyard as a state-based action.4/26/2014 : You still control the Aura, even if its enchanting a creature controlled by another player.4/26/2014 : If the enchanted creature leaves the battlefield, the Aura stops being an Aura and remains on the battlefield. Control of that permanent doesnt change; youll control the resulting enchantment creature.4/26/2014 : Similarly, if you cast an Aura spell with bestow targeting a creature controlled by another player, and that creature is an illegal target when the spell tries to resolve, it will finish resolving as an enchantment creature spell.

No permanents change controllers.4/26/2014 : If another spell or ability allows you to change the targets of the ability (or perhaps copy it and choose new targets for the copy), you can change the targets only such that the final set of targets is still legal. For example, if the ability targets a creature you control and a creature an opponent controls, you couldnt change just the second target to a noncreature permanent controlled by that player. You could, however, change just the second target to a creature controlled by a different opponent. The two new targets can share a different card type than the two original targets did.4/26/2014 : Although the permanent you control cant be a land, the other target can, provided it shares a card type with the first target. For example, you could target an artifact you control and an artifact land controlled by an opponent.4/26/2014 : Inspired abilities trigger no matter how the creature becomes untapped: by the turn-based action at the beginning of the untap step or by a spell or ability.4/26/2014 : If an inspired ability triggers during your untap step, the ability will be put on the stack at the beginning of your upkeep.

You cant choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.4/26/2014 : Auras attached to a creature dont become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.4/26/2014 : An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owners graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as its a creature. While its a creature, it cant be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura thats not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isnt a creature will be put into its owners graveyard as a state-based action.4/26/2014 : You still control the Aura, even if its enchanting a creature controlled by another player.4/26/2014 : If the enchanted creature leaves the battlefield, the Aura stops being an Aura and remains on the battlefield.

You cant look at face-down spells or permanents you dont control unless an effect instructs you to do so.9/20/2014 : You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. Youre not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear.

The copy or copies will then resolve like normal spells, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.9/20/2014 : Each copy will have the same targets as the spell its copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you cant choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal). You can choose different targets for each copy.9/20/2014 : If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says Choose one  or the like), each copy will have the same mode. You cant choose a different one.9/20/2014 : If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Craters Claws has), each copy will have the same value of X.9/20/2014 : Raid abilities care only that you attacked with a creature. It doesnt matter how many creatures you attacked with, or which opponent or planeswalker controlled by an opponent those creatures attacked.9/20/2014 : Raid abilities evaluate the entire turn to see if you attacked with a creature. That creature doesnt have to still be on the battlefield. Similarly, the player or planeswalker it attacked doesnt have to still be in the game or on the battlefield, respectively.||When you cast your next instant or sorcery spell this turn, copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.Raid  If you attacked with a creature this turn, when you cast your next instant or sorcery spell this turn, copy that spell an additional time.

Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. The two creatures arent on the battlefield at the same time. For example, if the returning creature is a Mercurial Pretender, it cant enter the battlefield as a copy of the Sliver.7/18/2014 : The exiled card will return to the battlefield under its owners control.7/18/2014 : The exiled card will return even if the Sliver whose ability exiled it doesnt have that ability at the time (perhaps because Constricting Sliver is no longer on the battlefield).7/18/2014 : In a multiplayer game, if the Slivers owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isnt an ability that goes on the stack, it wont cease to exist along with the leaving players spells and abilities on the stack.7/18/2014 : Slivers in this set affect only Sliver creatures you control.

This is the same way Slivers from the Magic 2014 core set worked, while Slivers in earlier sets granted bonuses to all Slivers.7/18/2014 : Abilities that Slivers grant, as well as power/toughness boosts, are cumulative.

Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.7/18/2014 : Because convoke isnt an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.7/18/2014 : Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creatures colors.7/18/2014 : When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spells total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, youll have to pay {1}{G}.7/18/2014 : If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spells costs. You wont be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature wont be on the battlefield when you pay the spells costs, so you wont be able to tap it for convoke.||Convoke #_(Your creatures can help cast this spell.

For example, if you activate The Chain Veils last ability, untap it, then activate it again, you can activate a loyalty ability of a planeswalker you control three times that turn.||At the beginning of your end step, if you didn't activate a loyalty ability of a planeswalker this turn, you lose 2 life.{4}, {T}: For each planeswalker you control, you may activate one of its loyalty abilities once this turn as though none of its loyalty abilities have been activated this turn.||||||||215|||Le Voile de Chane|Der Kettenschleier|Il Velo di Catena||O Vu Metlico| |El Velo de Cadenas| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||True|||||||||||||Thundering Giant|Magic 2015 Core Set|M15|383413|Creature  Giant|4|3||{3}{R}{R}|5|Mark Zug|#_The giant was felt a few seconds before he was seen._#|R||165|C|2.333|||Haste #_(This creature can attack and {T} as soon as it comes under your control.)_#||||||||165|||Gant fulminant|Donnerriese|Gigante Tonante||Gigante Trovejante| |Gigante descomunal| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||True|||||||||||||Tireless Missionaries|Magic 2015 Core Set|M15|383414|Creature  Human Cleric|2|3||{4}{W}|5|Dave Kendall|#_If they succeed in their holy work, their order will vanish into welcome obscurity, for there will be no more souls to redeem._#|W||39|C|0.571|||When Tireless Missionaries enters the battlefield, you gain 3 life.||||||||39|||Missionnaires infatigables|Unermdliche Missionare|Missionari Instancabili||Missionrios Incansveis| |Misioneros incansables|  |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||True|||||||||||||Titanic Growth|Magic 2015 Core Set|M15|383415|Instant||||{1}{G}|2|Ryan Pancoast|#_The massive dominate through might.

That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spells total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, youll have to pay {1}{G}.7/18/2014 : If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spells costs.

Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after Turn to Frog resolves will overwrite this effect.7/18/2014 : Turn to Frog doesnt counter abilities that have already triggered or been activated. In particular, there is no way to cast this spell to stop a creatures ability that says At the beginning of your upkeep, When this creature enters the battlefield, or similar from triggering.7/18/2014 : If the affected creature gains an ability after Turn to Frog resolves, it will keep that ability.7/18/2014 : Effects that modify a creatures power and/or toughness, such as the effect of Titanic Growth, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch its power and toughness.7/18/2014 : If one of the Theros block Gods is affected by Turn to Frog, it will be a legendary 1/1 blue Frog enchantment creature with no abilities.

The check happens only as that activated ability resolves. You must activate the ability in order to exile Chandra and return her to the battlefield transformed, even if Chandra has already dealt 3 or more damage during the turn.6/22/2015 : Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, power and toughness, loyalty, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face thats currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored. While a double-faced card isnt on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face.6/22/2015 : The converted mana cost of a double-faced card not on the battlefield is the converted mana cost of its front face.6/22/2015 : The back face of a double-faced card (in the case of Magic Origins, the planeswalker face) cant be cast.6/22/2015 : Although the two rules are similar, the legend rule and the planeswalker uniqueness rule affect different kinds of permanents. You can control two of this permanent, one front face-up and the other back-face up at the same time. However, if the former is exiled and enters the battlefield transformed, youll then control two planeswalkers with the same subtype. Youll choose one to remain on the battlefield, and the other will be put into its owners graveyard.6/22/2015 : A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up.6/22/2015 : A Magic Origins planeswalker that enters the battlefield because of the ability of its front face will enter with loyalty counters as normal.6/22/2015 : In some rare cases, a spell or ability may cause one of these five cards to transform while its a creature (front face up) on the battlefield. If this happens, the resulting planeswalker wont have any loyalty counters on it and will subsequently be put into its owners graveyard.6/22/2015 : You can activate one of the planeswalkers loyalty abilities the turn it enters the battlefield. However, you may do so only during one of your main phases when the stack is empty. For example, if the planeswalker enters the battlefield during combat, there will be an opportunity for your opponent to remove it before you can activate one of its abilities.6/22/2015 : If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down (this is also true if its put onto the battlefield face down some other way). Note that face down is not synonymous with with its back face up. A manifested double-faced card is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. While face down, it cant transform. If the front face of a manifested double-faced card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced card on the battlefield cant be turned face down.4/8/2016 : The back face of a double-faced card doesnt have a mana cost. A double-faced permanent with its back face up has a converted mana cost equal to the converted mana cost of its front face. Each back face has a color indicator that defines its color.4/8/2016 : For more information on double-faced cards, see the Shadows over Innistrad mechanics article (http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/shadows-over-innistrad-mechanics).||Whenever you cast a red spell, untap Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh.{T}: Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh deals 1 damage to target player.

He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: Gideon is just a planeswalker type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).6/22/2015 : If you activate Gideons third ability and then damage is dealt to him that cant be prevented, that damage has all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since hes a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since hes a planeswalker). If Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, hes put into his owners graveyard as a state-based action. (As long as he still has indestructible, the marked damage wont cause him to be destroyed.)6/22/2015 : Say you activate Gideons third ability, then an opponent gains control of him before combat. You may have any of your creatures attack Gideon (since hes still a planeswalker). Then Gideon may block (since hes a creature). He may block any eligible attacking creature, including one thats attacking him. During combat, he behaves as an attacked planeswalker and/or a blocking creature, as appropriate. For example, he deals combat damage to any creatures hes blocking, but he doesnt deal combat damage to any unblocked creatures that are attacking him.||+2: Up to one target creature an opponent controls attacks Gideon, Battle-Forged during its controller's next turn if able.+1: Until your next turn, target creature gains indestructible.

While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face thats currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored. While a double-faced card isnt on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face.6/22/2015 : The converted mana cost of a double-faced card not on the battlefield is the converted mana cost of its front face.6/22/2015 : The back face of a double-faced card (in the case of Magic Origins, the planeswalker face) cant be cast.6/22/2015 : Although the two rules are similar, the legend rule and the planeswalker uniqueness rule affect different kinds of permanents. You can control two of this permanent, one front face-up and the other back-face up at the same time. However, if the former is exiled and enters the battlefield transformed, youll then control two planeswalkers with the same subtype. Youll choose one to remain on the battlefield, and the other will be put into its owners graveyard.6/22/2015 : A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up.6/22/2015 : A Magic Origins planeswalker that enters the battlefield because of the ability of its front face will enter with loyalty counters as normal.6/22/2015 : In some rare cases, a spell or ability may cause one of these five cards to transform while its a creature (front face up) on the battlefield. If this happens, the resulting planeswalker wont have any loyalty counters on it and will subsequently be put into its owners graveyard.6/22/2015 : You can activate one of the planeswalkers loyalty abilities the turn it enters the battlefield. However, you may do so only during one of your main phases when the stack is empty. For example, if the planeswalker enters the battlefield during combat, there will be an opportunity for your opponent to remove it before you can activate one of its abilities.6/22/2015 : If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down (this is also true if its put onto the battlefield face down some other way).

If she enters the battlefield while you control seven or more lands, she wont automatically be exiled and transform.6/22/2015 : Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, power and toughness, loyalty, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face thats currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored. While a double-faced card isnt on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face.6/22/2015 : The converted mana cost of a double-faced card not on the battlefield is the converted mana cost of its front face.6/22/2015 : The back face of a double-faced card (in the case of Magic Origins, the planeswalker face) cant be cast.6/22/2015 : Although the two rules are similar, the legend rule and the planeswalker uniqueness rule affect different kinds of permanents. You can control two of this permanent, one front face-up and the other back-face up at the same time. However, if the former is exiled and enters the battlefield transformed, youll then control two planeswalkers with the same subtype. Youll choose one to remain on the battlefield, and the other will be put into its owners graveyard.6/22/2015 : A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up.6/22/2015 : A Magic Origins planeswalker that enters the battlefield because of the ability of its front face will enter with loyalty counters as normal.6/22/2015 : In some rare cases, a spell or ability may cause one of these five cards to transform while its a creature (front face up) on the battlefield. If this happens, the resulting planeswalker wont have any loyalty counters on it and will subsequently be put into its owners graveyard.6/22/2015 : You can activate one of the planeswalkers loyalty abilities the turn it enters the battlefield. However, you may do so only during one of your main phases when the stack is empty. For example, if the planeswalker enters the battlefield during combat, there will be an opportunity for your opponent to remove it before you can activate one of its abilities.6/22/2015 : If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down (this is also true if its put onto the battlefield face down some other way). Note that face down is not synonymous with with its back face up. A manifested double-faced card is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. While face down, it cant transform. If the front face of a manifested double-faced card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced card on the battlefield cant be turned face down.4/8/2016 : The back face of a double-faced card doesnt have a mana cost. A double-faced permanent with its back face up has a converted mana cost equal to the converted mana cost of its front face. Each back face has a color indicator that defines its color.4/8/2016 : For more information on double-faced cards, see the Shadows over Innistrad mechanics article (http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/shadows-over-innistrad-mechanics).||When Nissa, Vastwood Seer enters the battlefield, you may search your library for a basic Forest card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, if you control seven or more lands, exile Nissa, then return her to the battlefield transformed under her owner's control.|||||||398432|189|||Nissa, voyante de Vastebois|Nissa, Seherin aus Riesenholz|Nissa, Veggente di Boscovasto||Nissa, Vidente de Matavasta|,  |Nissa, vidente del Bosque Extenso|  |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||True|||||||||||||Nissa's Pilgrimage|Magic Origins|ORI|398593|Sorcery||||{2}{G}|3|Matt Stewart||G||190|C|5|6/22/2015 : If you only find one basic Forest card, youll put it onto the battlefield tapped.

Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.7/18/2014 : Because convoke isnt an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.7/18/2014 : Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creatures colors.7/18/2014 : When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X.

Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.7/18/2014 : Because convoke isnt an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.7/18/2014 : Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creatures colors.7/18/2014 : When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spells total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}.

Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.7/18/2014 : Convoke doesnt change a spells mana cost or converted mana cost.7/18/2014 : When calculating a spells total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.7/18/2014 : Because convoke isnt an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.7/18/2014 : Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creatures colors.7/18/2014 : When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spells total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, youll have to pay {1}{G}.7/18/2014 : If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spells costs. You wont be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature wont be on the battlefield when you pay the spells costs, so you wont be able to tap it for convoke.||Convoke #_(Your creatures can help cast this spell.

Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spells costs.

Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.7/18/2014 : Because convoke isnt an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.7/18/2014 : Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creatures colors.7/18/2014 : When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spells total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, youll have to pay {1}{G}.7/18/2014 : If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spells costs. You wont be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature wont be on the battlefield when you pay the spells costs, so you wont be able to tap it for convoke.||Convoke #_(Your creatures can help cast this spell.

Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell wont trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.1/22/2016 : The copy will have the same targets as the spell its copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you cant choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).1/22/2016 : If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says Choose one  or the like), the copy will have the same modes.

However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy, too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.1/22/2016 : For Mirrorpools last ability, the token copies exactly whats printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else; see below). It doesnt copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.1/22/2016 : For example, if a token copies a Plains thats been affected by a spell with awaken, the token will be just a land, even though the object being copied is currently a land creature. The same is true if the land has an ability that animates it.1/22/2016 : If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.1/22/2016 : If the copied creature is copying something else when the ability resolves, then the token enters the battlefield as a copy of whatever that creature is copying.1/22/2016 : Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield.

The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield wont trigger.1/22/2016 : An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creatures power and toughness. If the land was already a creature (for example, if it was the target of a spell with awaken), this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness will continue to apply no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. For example, if Needle Spires has been made a 0/0 creature with three +1/+1 counters on it, activating its last ability will turn it into a 5/4 creature thats still a land.||Needle Spires enters the battlefield tapped.{T}: Add {R} or {W} to your mana pool.{2}{R}{W}: Needle Spires becomes a 2/1 red and white Elemental creature with double strike until end of turn.
